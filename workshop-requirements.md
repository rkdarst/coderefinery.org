## Lecture room

- The room needs to be sufficiently large (a typical workshop is attended by
  around 20 learners and 4 instructors)
- There needs to be enough space for instructors to walk around and interact
  with learners individually (a "flat" room is required)
- Learners should face the same direction, and learners should be able to sit
  side-by-side for pairwise work
- The room should preferably have windows, and be ventilated well enough so
  that 20-30 people (and same amount of laptops) will not make it too warm
- A coffee room, cafe, or similar should be located nearby for the coffee breaks
- Two overhead projectors are desirable, but if only one is available that will
  work too
- The projector screen needs to be large, and the resolution of the projector
  needs to be good
- Stable wireless connectivity for 20-30 people
- Sufficiently many electricity outlets so that all participants can charge
  their laptops
- Standing board

## Other requirements

When we organize a workshop or event at a new site, we may need help with some local arrangements,
including:

- Booking a lecture room
- Ordering coffee and refreshments
- Advertise the workshop through local dissemination channels (we handle registration)
- If possible, finding advanced users to be helpers.  Or being a helper yourself.  Don't worry,
  we help the helpers too.

## Misc

An ideal room: tables for group work, dual projectors, room to walk
around and talk to every seat.
